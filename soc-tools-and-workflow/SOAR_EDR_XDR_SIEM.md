# 🛡️ SIEM, SOAR, EDR & XDR – SOC Core Technologies

## Introduction
Modern Security Operations Centers (SOC) rely on multiple security platforms to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats. The most important technologies are SIEM, SOAR, EDR, and XDR. Each of these tools performs a specific role in the cybersecurity defense lifecycle.

## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
SIEM is the central system used to collect and analyze logs from all IT assets such as servers, firewalls, endpoints, applications, and cloud platforms. It correlates events from different sources and detects suspicious activity.

SIEM is mainly used for:
- Log collection and storage  
- Threat detection  
- Alert generation  
- Incident investigation  
- Compliance reporting  

Examples: Splunk, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel

## SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)
SOAR is used to automate incident response. When an alert is generated by SIEM or XDR, SOAR executes predefined playbooks to take actions automatically.

SOAR is used for:
- Automating incident response  
- Blocking malicious IPs  
- Disabling compromised accounts  
- Creating tickets and notifications  
- Reducing analyst workload  

Examples: Splunk SOAR, Palo Alto XSOAR, Tines

## EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
EDR monitors and protects individual devices such as laptops, servers, and workstations. It detects malicious activities by analyzing processes, file changes, and network connections on each endpoint.

EDR is used for:
- Detecting malware and ransomware  
- Monitoring endpoint activity  
- Isolating infected systems  
- Providing forensic data  

Examples: CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, SentinelOne

## XDR (Extended Detection and Response)
XDR is an advanced security platform that extends EDR by collecting and correlating data from endpoints, networks, email, cloud, and identity systems. It provides a full view of an attack across the organization.

XDR is used for:
- Detecting complex attacks  
- Correlating data from multiple sources  
- Reducing alert noise  
- Providing unified threat visibility  

Examples: Microsoft Defender XDR, Palo Alto Cortex XDR

## How They Work Together in a SOC
EDR and XDR detect suspicious activity on systems. SIEM collects logs and generates security alerts. SOAR automates the response actions. Together, these tools form a complete SOC workflow for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | SIEM | SOAR | EDR | XDR |
|--------|------|------|------|------|
| Primary Role | Log analysis and detection | Automated response | Endpoint security | Unified detection |
| Data Source | Logs from all systems | Alerts and tools | Endpoints | Endpoints, network, cloud |
| Detects threats | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Responds automatically | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Scope | Organization-wide | SOC operations | Individual devices | Entire infrastructure |

---

## Summary
SIEM provides visibility by analyzing logs, SOAR automates incident response, EDR protects individual systems, and XDR delivers a complete view of threats across the organization. A modern SOC uses all four technologies together to achieve fast, accurate, and effective cybersecurity operations.
