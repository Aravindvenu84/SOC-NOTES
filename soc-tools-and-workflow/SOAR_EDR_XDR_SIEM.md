🛡️ SIEM, SOAR, EDR & XDR – SOC Core Technologies
📌 Introduction

Modern Security Operations Centers (SOC) use multiple security platforms to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats. The four most important technologies are:

SIEM

SOAR

EDR

XDR

Each one plays a different role in protecting an organization.

🔹 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

SIEM is the central logging and detection system in a SOC.
It collects logs from all IT systems such as:

Servers

Firewalls

Endpoints

Network devices

Cloud services

SIEM analyzes these logs to detect security incidents.
