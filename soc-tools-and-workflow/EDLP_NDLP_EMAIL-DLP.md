# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – EDLP, NDLP and Email DLP

## Introduction
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a cybersecurity strategy used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, leakage, or theft. Organizations use DLP solutions to monitor, detect, and block the movement of confidential data across different channels such as endpoints, networks, and email systems.

DLP ensures that important information like customer data, financial records, and intellectual property does not leave the organization without authorization.

## EDLP (Endpoint Data Loss Prevention)
Endpoint DLP protects data on user devices such as laptops, desktops, and USB drives. It monitors how users handle sensitive files and prevents actions like copying, uploading, or printing confidential data.

EDLP helps to:
- Prevent data theft from employee devices  
- Block unauthorized file transfers  
- Control USB and removable media usage  
- Protect data even when users are offline

## NDLP (Network Data Loss Prevention)
Network DLP monitors data moving through the organization’s network. It scans internet traffic, file transfers, and communications to detect sensitive information leaving the company.

NDLP helps to:
- Detect data exfiltration  
- Monitor web uploads and downloads  
- Prevent data leaks over the internet  
- Protect data in transit

## Email DLP
Email DLP focuses on protecting sensitive data sent through email. It scans email content, attachments, and links before delivery.

Email DLP helps to:
- Prevent accidental or intentional data leaks  
- Block sensitive data from being emailed outside the company  
- Enforce compliance with data protection laws  
- Reduce insider threats

## Objective of DLP in Organizations
The main objective of DLP is to ensure that sensitive data is not accessed, shared, or leaked without authorization. It helps organizations maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance.

- It prevents financial and data theft  
- It protects customer and company information  
- It ensures regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)  
- It reduces insider threats  
- It maintains trust and business reputation

## Summary
EDLP protects data on user devices, NDLP protects data moving across the network, and Email DLP protects data sent via email. Together, these DLP systems provide complete protection against data leakage and help organizations keep their sensitive information secure.
