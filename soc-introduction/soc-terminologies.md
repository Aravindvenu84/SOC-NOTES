# SOC Key Terms Glossary

This glossary compiles **20–25 essential SOC terms**, provides clear definitions, and groups them under categories for Monitoring, Detection, Response, and Reporting.

## Monitoring

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** | Platform that collects, correlates, and analyzes security events and logs from multiple sources in real-time. |
| **Log Management** | The collection, storage, and analysis of system, network, and application logs for security monitoring. |
| **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** | Security solution that monitors endpoints for suspicious behavior and facilitates investigation and remediation. |
| **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)** | Process of monitoring and analyzing network flows to detect anomalies or malicious activity. |
| **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** | Analyzes normal behavior patterns of users and devices to identify anomalies that may indicate threats. |
| **Asset Inventory** | A record of all hardware and software assets within an organization, used to monitor and secure systems. |
| **Vulnerability Scan** | Automated assessment of systems to detect known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. |

## Detection

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **IOC (Indicator of Compromise)** | Artifacts or evidence (e.g., IP addresses, hashes, domain names) that indicate a system has been compromised. |
| **Correlation Rule** | A rule in a SIEM or security tool that connects multiple events to detect potential threats. |
| **False Positive** | An alert triggered by benign activity that is incorrectly identified as malicious. |
| **Threat Intelligence (TI)** | Information about current or emerging threats, such as malware signatures, attack patterns, or threat actors. |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | Monitors network or system activity for malicious behavior or policy violations. |
| **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** | Detects and actively blocks suspicious activity in real-time. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Identifying unusual patterns in logs or traffic that may indicate malicious activity. |
| **Exploit** | Code or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability in a system. |
| **Malware** | Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. |
| **Brute Force Attack** | Repeated attempts to guess passwords or credentials to gain unauthorized access. |

## Response

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Incident Response (IR)** | Structured process to detect, investigate, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents. |
| **Containment** | Actions taken to limit the impact or spread of a security incident. |
| **Eradication** | Removing malicious elements (malware, exploits, backdoors) from affected systems. |
| **Remediation** | Applying fixes, patches, or controls to restore systems to a secure state. |
| **Threat Hunting** | Proactively searching for threats in the environment that may evade detection systems. |
| **Playbook** | Documented procedures and steps for responding to specific types of security incidents. |
| **Forensics** | Analysis of digital evidence to understand how an incident occurred and what was affected. |
| **Recovery** | Restoring affected systems and services to normal operations after an incident. |

## Reporting

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Ticketing System** | Platform used to log, track, and manage security incidents (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira, TheHive). |
| **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)** | Average time taken to identify a security incident after it occurs. |
| **MTTR (Mean Time to Respond/Recover)** | Average time taken to contain, remediate, and recover from an incident. |
| **SOC Dashboard** | Visual interface showing key metrics, alerts, and security posture for SOC analysts. |
| **Compliance** | Adherence to industry regulations and standards, such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, or GDPR. |
| **Alert Triage** | Process of evaluating and prioritizing security alerts for further investigation. |

**Summary:**  
This glossary categorizes essential SOC terms into **Monitoring, Detection, Response, and Reporting**. Understanding these terms helps SOC analysts efficiently detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents while maintaining proper reporting and compliance.
